          <p>
            Let me tell you more about myself then. I started studying at KEA,
            because I decided that I wanted to completely change my direction,
            and since I was always intruiged and interested in fornt end, I saw
            a multi media design study programme at KEA as a perfect opportunity
            to get the knowledge and start my path as front end developer.
            <br />
            I really enjoy coding and the challenges it can have, because there
            is always at least few ways how to solve a problem and this of
            cource inevitably helps to be in the position of constant
            improvement or frustration...but either way I enjoy it because of
            these reasons.
            <br />
            A little bit about my proffesional background for about 5-6 years
            prior to education I was in a beauty/service industry responsible
            with customer support and providing service. I used to do eyelash
            extensions at a beauty salon but after a while I decided to open my
            own and it was a learning experience, that taught me a lot in
            general and what I would like my job to be. <br />
            One of the main reasons why i decided to stop my busssiness and
            pursue this is because I felt like I wasn't growing proffesionally
            anymore. That was one of the main things that made front end
            development so interestnig for me.
            <br />
            Maybe the lsat few things i'd like to say about me is that I am
            motivated, independent and friendly person, I have few hobbies, none
            of whicha are really impressive.
